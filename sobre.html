           Kevin's Story
        </h2>
        <p ALIGN = "CENTER">
         <p>Once upon a time, Kevin was the most elusive computer break-in artist in history. His famous ‘electronic joyride’ made him part of the FBI’s most wanted list for hacking into more than 40 major corporations, just for the challenge of it. 

Kevin gained access to the computers and networks of the world's biggest companies while eluding the authorities through phone switches, computer systems and cellular networks. For three years he went on the run, using false identities and escaping from city to city until a final showdown with the Feds, who would stop at nothing to bring him down. 

Kevin’s creativity, skills and persistence forced the authorities to rethink the way they pursued hackers. Those ripples brought permanent changes to the way companies and people protect their most sensitive information. His story became legendary and is the basis for many books, articles, films and TV programs</p>
